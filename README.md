# PostgreSQL Diagnostic Views

A set of diagnostic (over)views of the statistics collected by PostgreSQL.

Many queries adapted from [heroku-pg-extras][pg-extras].

[pg-extras]: https://github.com/heroku/heroku-pg-extras

## Install

Some views depend on the extension `pg_stat_statements`.

The views are created in a `pgdv` schema by the `create.sql` file.

```
postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
postgres=# \i pgdv/create.sql
```

## Usage

The views are documented with `COMMENT` and can be listed through the
`pgdv.views` view of views.

```
postgres=# SELECT * FROM pgdv.views;
          view          |              description
